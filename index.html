Iâ€™m Xiaoxia Huang, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/). My research focuses on gender and bureaucracy in East Asia, with a particular emphasis on China. In my dissertation, I investigate gender representation in the Chinese civil service and the resulting backlash using original datasets. My other ongoing projects explore topics such as gender quotas and representation in leadership positions, women in law enforcement, and the distribution of public sector jobs in China. </div> </body></html>
